# Website Images

This directory should contain:

1. **hero-screenshot.png** - Main game screenshot for the hero section (800x600 recommended)
2. **gameplay.png** - Screenshot showing active gameplay
3. **icon.png** - App icon (512x512)

## How to Create Screenshots

1. Launch P2P Go from the DMG
2. Create a game and place some stones
3. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on macOS)
4. Save as the appropriate filename

## Placeholder
For now, the website will work without images, but adding them will greatly improve the appearance.
