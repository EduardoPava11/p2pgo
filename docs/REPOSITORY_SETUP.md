## Analytics (Optional)

If you want basic analytics without compromising privacy:
- Use Plausible or Umami (privacy-focused)

1. GitHub Discussions for community help
2. Issues for bugs and features
3. Optional: Discord server for real-time chat

Remember: The goal is a community-driven project that respects user privacy while providing an excellent Go experience!
