# P2P Go Project Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Offline Game (Ready to Play!)
- **9x9 Board**: Beautiful rendering with golden ratio aesthetics
- **9-Layer Stone Gradients**: Matching the 9x9 board dimensions
- **Territory Marking**: Click-to-toggle system for scoring
- **Guild Classification**: Shows your play style after 5 moves
- **Score Calculation**: Detailed breakdown with clear arithmetic
- **Responsive UI**: Board scales with window, maintains square aspect

### Visual Design
- **Middle Gray Base**: UI color at RGB(127,127,127) ready for neural net shifts
- **Golden Ratio**: Used for stone highlights and proportions
- **Smooth Animations**: Proper hover states and visual feedback
- **Clean Layout**: Minimal chrome, game-focused design

### Guild System
- **Three Orthogonal Styles**:
  - Activity (Red): Forward vectors, aggressive play
  - Reactivity (Blue): Response vectors, defensive play
  - Avoidance (Green): Balance seeking, territorial play
- **Move Analysis**: Each move evaluated through three perspectives
- **Binary Fuel Credits**: 1 credit = 1 relay hop or 1 new friend

### Economic Foundation
- **DJED Stablecoin**: Proper minimal implementation from the paper
- **DEX Order Book**: Relay network as computation layer
- **Marketplace Structure**: For trading neural network models

## üöß Next Development Phase

### 1. Relay Network (Priority)
- Basic P2P connectivity
- Game synchronization
- Move validation
- NAT traversal

### 2. Neural Network Integration
- Move suggestions (limited per game)
- Win probability calculation
- UI color shifting based on position evaluation

### 3. Visual Topology Viewer
- Relay network as Go board diagram
- Dijkstra's shortest path visualization
- Real-time network health display

## üéÆ Current State

The offline game is **fully playable** with:
- Proper Go rules implementation
- Territory marking for scoring
- Guild affinity tracking
- Beautiful stone rendering
- Responsive board layout

The app opens at 900x900px with the board properly centered and scaled. All UI elements are polished and game-ready.

## üîÑ Development Philosophy

As you requested, we're focusing on:
1. **Game First**: Perfect offline play experience
2. **Then Relay**: P2P connectivity layer
3. **Then Economics**: Value capture and transfer

The foundation is solid. The game is beautiful. The systems are designed. Now we can build upward from this stable base.
