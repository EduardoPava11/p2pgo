# P2P Go Status - July 3rd

## âœ… Completed

### 1. Simple 2-Relay Testing Setup
- Created `simple_relay.rs` for direct 2-node testing
- Bypasses complex discovery for initial testing
- Configuration:
  ```rust
  // First relay
  port: 4001
  
  // Second relay  
  port: 4002
  remote_relay: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001"
  ```

### 2. GitHub-Based Updates
- Auto-update foundation exists in `auto_update.rs`
- Points to: `https://api.github.com/repos/p2pgo/p2pgo/releases`
- Created `scripts/check_updates.sh` for manual checking
- Ready for GitHub Releases integration

### 3. UI Design System
- Created unified `design_system.rs` centered on 9x9 board aesthetic
- Signature colors:
  - Board wood: RGB(220, 179, 92) - your trademark!
  - Dark wood: RGB(139, 90, 43)
  - Light wood: RGB(245, 222, 179)
- Consistent typography: Open Sans font family
- Spacing based on 30px grid unit (board cell size)
- Applied to:
  - Board widget (uses consistent colors)
  - Main app (applies design system on update)

### 4. Core Module
- âœ… Builds successfully
- Burn ML integration working
- CBOR serialization for game state
- Ko detection and pattern generation

## ðŸš§ Current State

### Network Module
- Has compilation errors due to libp2p 0.53 API changes
- RNA (training data) system designed
- Relay discovery and profitability specs documented
- Needs work to compile with current libp2p version

### Testing Strategy
1. Start with 2 relays (direct connection)
2. Test game play and training
3. Scale to 3+ relays
4. Launch with free training (no credits initially)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Fix Network Compilation**
   - Update to match libp2p 0.53 API
   - Or temporarily stub out network for offline testing

2. **Polish UI**
   - Apply design system to all components
   - Ensure menu/training match 9x9 board aesthetic
   - Test all UI flows

3. **Prepare for Launch**
   - Set up GitHub releases
   - Create social media accounts
   - Remove credit system code for initial free version

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Trademark: The 9x9 Board

The warm wood 9x9 board (RGB 220, 179, 92) is now the central design element. All UI components will follow this aesthetic to create a cohesive, distinctive look that represents P2P Go.
