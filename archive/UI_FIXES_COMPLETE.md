# UI Fixes Complete

All 7 UI issues have been fixed in the 2D Go game:

## 1. ✅ Fixed Board Size Stability
- The board no longer changes size after the 5th move
- Used fixed layout with `allocate_ui_with_layout` to reserve space
- Board maintains consistent size throughout the game

## 2. ✅ Added Red Outline for Territory Marking
- Territory marks now have a red outline for better visibility
- Works with all territory marker types (square, circle, cross, fill, overlay)

## 4. ✅ Added Dead Stone Marking

## 5. ✅ Replaced Percentages with Bar Graph
- Guild affinity now shown as horizontal bar graph
- Visual representation instead of distracting percentages
- Clean, non-intrusive display

## 6. ✅ Added Toggle for Guild Statistics
- "Show Stats" / "Hide Stats" button
