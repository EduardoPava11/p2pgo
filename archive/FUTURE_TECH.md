# Future Technology Stack

## ink! Smart Contracts

### Overview
ink! is a Rust-based eDSL for writing smart contracts on Substrate-based blockchains. For P2P Go, this would enable:

### Potential Use Cases
1. **Game State Verification**
   - On-chain proof of game outcomes
   - Immutable move history
   - Tournament brackets and results

2. **Token Economics**
   - DJED stablecoin minting/burning logic
   - Reserve coin mechanisms
   - Automated market making

3. **Governance**
   - Guild voting mechanisms
   - Relay node selection
   - Protocol parameter updates

### Implementation Considerations
- Would require Substrate parachain or standalone chain
- Gas fees for contract execution
- State storage costs
- Bridge to existing relay network

### Research Tasks
- [ ] Evaluate ink! vs other smart contract platforms
- [ ] Design minimal governance contract
- [ ] Prototype game verification contract
- [ ] Cost analysis for on-chain storage

## Burn Framework Integration

### Current Usage
- Neural network training for game AI
- WGPU backend for GPU acceleration
- Tensor operations for board evaluation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Distributed Training**
   - Federated learning across player devices
   - Model averaging protocols
   - Privacy-preserving gradients

2. **Model Compression**
   - Quantization for mobile devices
   - Pruning for faster inference
   - Knowledge distillation pipeline

3. **Real-time Inference**
   - Move suggestion system
   - Position evaluation
   - Pattern recognition

### Performance Targets
- Inference under 100ms on mobile
- Model size under 10MB
- Training on 1000 games/hour

## Relay Network Evolution

### Phase 1: Basic Connectivity (Current)
- P2P game connections
