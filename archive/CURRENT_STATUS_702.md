# P2P Go Current Status - July 2, 2025

## âœ… Completed Today

### 1. **Cleaned Codebase**
- Removed all PNG asset files (stones are rendered programmatically)
- Updated README to reflect Circuit Relay v2 (not Iroh)
- Removed outdated documentation

### 2. **Combined 2D and 3D Games**
- Single program with mode switcher in menu bar
- Traditional 2D (9Ã—9) with OGS-style clean UI
- 3D Three-Plane mode (243 positions, not 729)

### 3. **3D Go Implementation**
- **Correct Geometry**: Three orthogonal 9Ã—9 planes intersecting at middle
  - XY plane at Z=4
  - XZ plane at Y=4 
  - YZ plane at X=4
- **Total Positions**: 243 (81 per plane with shared intersections)
- **Three Players**: Black, White, Red taking turns
- **Visualization**: Main view + 3D overview
- **Navigation**: Switch between three plane views

### 4. **Circuit Relay v2 Started**
- Created `circuit_relay_v2.rs` with 3-player support
- Binary credit system (1 credit = 1 hop)
- Triangular topology for resilience
- Message types for game moves and relay requests

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

### Launch the Game
```bash
./launch_offline.sh
```
Or install from DMG: `P2PGo-Offline-20250702.dmg`

### Game Modes
1. **2D Mode**: Traditional 9Ã—9 Go
   - Clean white board with black grid
   - Simplified stone rendering
   - Guild classification
   - Territory marking

2. **3D Mode**: Three intersecting planes
   - 243 valid positions
   - Three players
   - Click to place spherical stones
   - View each plane separately

## ðŸ“š Documentation Created

### Technical Design
- `GO_NEURAL_NETS_FOR_RELAY.md` - Using Go AI for network optimization
- `CIRCUIT_RELAY_V2_DESIGN.md` - 3-player relay protocol
- `3D_GO_DESIGN.md` - Three-plane game mechanics

### Key Insights
- Go neural nets can optimize relay routing
- Territory control maps to bandwidth allocation
- Move patterns map to routing patterns
- 3-player dynamics create Byzantine fault tolerance

## ðŸš§ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Complete Circuit Relay v2**
   - Network transport layer
   - Credit tracking UI
   - Connection establishment

2. **3D Game Rules**
   - Capture detection across planes
   - Territory calculation in 3D
   - Win conditions for 3 players

3. **Integration**
   - Connect relay to game moves
   - Visualize network as Go board
   - Test with local instances

### Testing Plan
```bash
# Terminal 1: Bootstrap
./p2pgo --relay --port 9000

# Terminal 2-4: Three players
./p2pgo --connect localhost:9000 --port 9001
./p2pgo --connect localhost:9000 --port 9002  
./p2pgo --connect localhost:9000 --port 9003
```

## ðŸ”‘ Key Achievements

1. **Unified Program**: Both 2D and 3D in one app
2. **Correct 3D Geometry**: Three planes, not cube
3. **Clean Architecture**: Ready for relay integration
4. **No External Assets**: Everything rendered programmatically
5. **Research Foundation**: Go AI â†’ Network optimization

The offline game works perfectly. The 3D visualization correctly shows three intersecting planes. The Circuit Relay v2 foundation is in place for 3-player networking.
