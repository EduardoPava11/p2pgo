# Using Go Neural Networks for Relay Network Optimization

## Overview

Go neural networks like AlphaGo/KataGo have learned sophisticated patterns for evaluating board positions and predicting optimal moves. These same principles can be applied to optimize relay network routing and resource allocation.

## Key Insights from Go AI Research

### 1. **Position Evaluation Networks**
- **Go**: Evaluate board strength and territory control
- **Relay**: Evaluate network health and resource distribution
- **Mapping**: Each relay node = board position, bandwidth = influence

### 2. **Policy Networks**
- **Go**: Predict best moves from current position
- **Relay**: Predict optimal routing paths and relay selection
- **Mapping**: Move selection → Route selection

### 3. **Value Networks**
- **Go**: Predict game outcome from current position
- **Relay**: Predict network reliability and performance
- **Mapping**: Win probability → Network success rate

## Mapping Go Concepts to Relay Networks

### Territory → Bandwidth Regions
```
Go: Control of board regions
Relay: Bandwidth allocation zones
Benefit: Efficient resource distribution
```

### Influence → Network Coverage
```
Go: Stone influence on empty points
Relay: Node influence on network paths
Benefit: Predict coverage gaps
```

### Life/Death → Node Reliability
```
Go: Group survival analysis
Relay: Node failure prediction
Benefit: Proactive redundancy
```

### Joseki → Routing Patterns
```
Go: Standard opening patterns
Relay: Common routing configurations
Benefit: Fast pattern matching
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. **Reuse Existing Models**
- Start with pretrained Go models (KataGo weights)
- Fine-tune final layers for network metrics
- Transfer learned spatial patterns

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
```python
# Go features → Network features
board_position → node_topology
stone_color → node_affiliation
liberties → available_bandwidth
territory → coverage_area
influence → signal_strength
```

### 3. **Training Pipeline**
1. Collect relay network data in SGF-like format
2. Convert network states to "board positions"
3. Use Go training infrastructure
4. Evaluate on network-specific metrics

### 4. **3-Player Adaptation**
- Our 3D Go with three players maps naturally to:
  - Byzantine fault tolerance (3 actors)
  - Triangular relay paths
  - Three-way consensus

## Concrete Benefits

### 1. **Efficient Training**
- Leverage billions of Go games for pretraining
- Transfer spatial reasoning to network topology
- Reduce training time by 90%

### 2. **Interpretability**
- Visualize network as Go board
- Understand AI decisions through Go concepts
- Debug using Go analysis tools

### 3. **Scalability**
- Go AI handles 19×19 = 361 positions
- Can scale to networks with 300+ nodes
- Hierarchical evaluation like Go sectors

## Example: Relay Selection as Move Selection

```rust
// Go move selection
fn select_move(board: &Board, model: &NeuralNet) -> Move {
    let policy = model.predict_policy(board);
    let value = model.predict_value(board);
    mcts_search(board, policy, value)
}

// Relay selection (adapted)
fn select_relay(network: &Network, model: &NeuralNet) -> RelayNode {
    let policy = model.predict_routes(network);
    let value = model.predict_reliability(network);
    mcts_search(network, policy, value)
}
```

## Research Directions

### 1. **Multi-Resolution Networks**
- 9×9 for local clusters
- 13×13 for regional networks
- 19×19 for global topology

### 2. **Temporal Dynamics**
- Go: Sequential moves
- Relay: Time-varying traffic
- Solution: Recurrent architectures

### 3. **Adversarial Robustness**
- Go: Opponent moves
- Relay: Network attacks
- Solution: Self-play against adversaries

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype**: Convert relay states to Go positions
2. **Train**: Fine-tune KataGo on network data
3. **Evaluate**: Measure routing efficiency
4. **Iterate**: Improve feature mapping

The elegance of this approach is that we can reuse the entire Go AI ecosystem - tools, models, and training infrastructure - for optimizing decentralized networks.
