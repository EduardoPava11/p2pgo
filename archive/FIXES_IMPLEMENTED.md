# Fixes Implemented

## 1. âœ… Capture Rules for 2D Go

The fundamental capture rule is now implemented:
- When a group of stones has no liberties (empty adjacent points), it is captured
- Captured stones are removed from the board
- Capture count is tracked for scoring
- Ko rule validation prevents immediate recapture
- Suicide moves are blocked

### Implementation Details
- `GameState::apply_move()` now returns `Vec<GameEvent>` including capture events
- Uses the existing `RuleValidator` to find captured stones
- Properly removes captured stones from the board
- Updates capture counts for both players

## 2. âœ… 3D Wireframe Visualization

The 3D Go board now correctly shows:
- **Wireframe boxes** instead of flat planes
- **Three intersecting 9Ã—9 grids** (not a full 9Ã—9Ã—9 cube)
- **Rotatable view** - drag to rotate the board in 3D space
- **243 valid positions** on the three orthogonal planes
- **Intersection highlights** where planes meet

### Key Features
- XY plane at Z=0 (horizontal)
- XZ plane at Y=0 (vertical front-back)
- YZ plane at X=0 (vertical left-right)
- All three planes share the center position (0,0,0)
- Click on wireframe boxes to place spherical stones
- Three players: Black, White, Red

## 3. ðŸŽ® How to Test

### 2D Go with Captures
1. Launch the game
2. Select "2D (9Ã—9)" mode
3. Surround opponent stones to capture them
4. Console will show "Captured X stones" messages
5. Captured stones disappear from board

### 3D Wireframe Go
1. Launch the game
2. Select "3D (Three Planes)" mode
3. Drag to rotate the 3D view
4. Click on wireframe boxes to place stones
5. Stones appear as spheres at grid intersections

## 4. ðŸ“¦ Updated DMG

The new `P2PGo-Offline-20250702.dmg` includes:
- Proper Go rules with captures
- 3D wireframe visualization
- Both game modes in one program

## 5. ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### For 2D Go
- Add visual feedback for captures (fade animation)
- Show captured stones next to board
- Add sound effects for captures

### For 3D Go
- Implement capture rules for 3D
- Add win conditions for 3 players
- Improve click detection on wireframe
- Add transparency slider to see through layers

The game now properly implements the fundamental Go rule of capture, making it a real Go game rather than just stone placement!
