# Offline Game UI Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Board Size Changing After 5th Move ✅
**Problem**: The board was resizing when guild statistics appeared
**Solution**: 
- Used fixed layout with reserved space for all UI elements
- Pre-allocated space for score/guild info area (200px) even when not shown
- Fixed board container size to prevent any resizing
- Separated UI into fixed-height sections

### 2. Guild Percentages Moving on Hover ✅  
**Problem**: Guild calculations were happening during gameplay on hover
**Solution**:
- Removed guild calculations during gameplay
- Changed hover sense to click sense where appropriate
- Guild affinity is now calculated ONLY at game end
- Removed all hover-based guild updates

### 3. Additional Fixes Applied ✅
- Red outlines for territory marking
- Flood fill territory selection 
- Dead stone marking by clicking groups
- Guild statistics as bar graph (not percentages)
- Toggle button for guild statistics
- Professional layout matching OGS style

## Technical Details

The issue was in the `offline_game.rs` module:
- Guild calculations were being performed on every move
- UI layout was not properly fixed, allowing elements to shift
- Hover interactions were triggering unnecessary updates

2. **Launch**: Run the P2P Go Offline app
3. **Play**: Click to place stones, no distractions during play
4. **End Game**: Pass-Pass to end, then see guild classification
