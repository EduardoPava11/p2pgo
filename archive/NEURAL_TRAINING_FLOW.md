- **Filtering Options**:
  - By move count (min/max)
  - By Ko situations (with/without)
  - By game result
- **Batch Selection**: Select multiple games for training
- **Game Details**: View move count, result, and Ko information

### 3. Ko Situation Handling
- **Automatic Detection**: Analyzes all games for Ko situations
- **Ko Statistics**: Shows percentage of games with Ko
- **Detailed Analysis**: Lists all Ko situations with move numbers
- **Synthetic Generation**: Creates Ko patterns when none exist in data

### 4. Neural Network Visualization

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"No valid SGF files found"**
   - Ensure files have .sgf extension
   - Check file format is valid SGF

2. **"Failed to parse SGF"**
   - Verify SGF syntax is correct
   - Check for corrupted files

3. **"No Ko situations found"**
   - Use "Generate Ko Training Patterns" feature
   - Upload games known to contain Ko

4. **"Insufficient training data"**
   - Upload more games (minimum 10 required)
   - Use data augmentation option

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Diverse Training Data**: Upload games from various skill levels
2. **Ko Situations**: Include games with Ko for better training
3. **Batch Processing**: Use folder upload for large datasets
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Check error logs for issues
5. **Visualization**: Use neural overlay to verify training effectiveness

## Technical Details
