- ‚úÖ **macOS Integration**: Proper macOS directory structure and file handling

### Network Architecture
- ‚úÖ **Complete Router**: gossip, docs, blobs, and P2P protocols properly wired
- ‚úÖ **Gossip API**: Working integration with iroh-gossip for real-time communication
- ‚úÖ **Blob Storage**: Game moves stored as content-addressed blobs with validation
- ‚úÖ **Document Sync**: Game state synchronized via Iroh docs for consistency

## üöÄ DELIVERED FEATURES

### CLI Application (`p2pgo-cli`)
```bash
# Host a new game
cargo run --bin p2pgo-cli -- --role host --size 19

# Join existing game  
cargo run --bin p2pgo-cli -- --role join --game-id <id>

# Run as spectator seed node
cargo run --bin p2pgo-cli -- --spectator

# Connect via ticket
cargo run --bin p2pgo-cli -- --ticket <ticket-string>

# List available games
cargo run --bin p2pgo-cli -- --list
```

### GUI Application (`p2pgo-ui-egui`)
- Modern eGUI interface with real-time board updates
- Network-aware game state management  
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Integrated crash logging and error handling

### Network Layer (`p2pgo-network`)
- **IrohCtx**: Main networking context with endpoint management
- **GameChannel**: Real-time move broadcasting and synchronization
- **Lobby**: Game discovery and matchmaking
- **BlobStore**: Content-addressed storage for game moves
- **ArchiveManager**: Automatic game persistence with rotation
- **CrashLogger**: Production-ready logging with size limits

### Core Game Engine (`p2pgo-core`)
- Complete Go rules implementation (captures, ko, territory scoring)
- CBOR serialization for network efficiency
- SGF import/export for game records
- Scoring engine with territory calculation

## üèóÔ∏è BUILD & DISTRIBUTION

### Cargo-Dist Configuration
```toml
# Builds for macOS universal-2 (Intel + Apple Silicon)
targets = ["universal2-apple-darwin"]

# Generates signed DMG packages
[target.universal2-apple-darwin]
installers = ["homebrew"]
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Automatically triggers on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Builds universal binary for macOS
- Creates GitHub releases with DMG downloads
- Includes checksums and signatures

### Directory Structure
```
~/Library/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Support/p2pgo/finished/  # Archived games (.cbor)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Logs/p2pgo/                          # Crash logs (1GB rotation)
```
